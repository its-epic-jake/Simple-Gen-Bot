# Simple-Gen-Bot

This is a simple bot ment for giving out serials or accounts to users. I am not responceible for what you do with this code.

Cooldown.txt, will store how much time you want your users to wait between getting accounts. The time scale is in seconds.

Token.txt, is for your bots token.

Accounts.txt, is where your accounts will be stored (They will be delted from this file after they are sent to a user.).
